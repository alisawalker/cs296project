We hereby declare, that all the work that has been submitted was done by all the three of us and we have not plagiarized it from anywhere.

OOP Principles used:
Inheritance:
Inherited the class MovieStatistics from the class Help since it needed functions of the Help class for the gender count and such.
Inherited the class FindActors from MovieStatistics since it also needed the functions of both help and Movie statistics class, like determining the villain.

Encapsulation
While implementing the methods of MovieStatistics we are asking for the data but are unable to change it.
